#DESCRIPTION:
#Wrote a simple Python program that identifies which generation you belong to based on your birth year ğŸ‘¶ğŸ“…ğŸ‘´
#The script takes user input, compares the year against known generational ranges, and responds with a personalized message. Great way to practice using if/elif/else statements and user interaction!

print("What generation are you a part of?")

name = input("Enter your name: ")
year = int(input("Enter your birth year: "))
print()
